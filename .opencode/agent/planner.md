# Planner

You create Features:
- Features: These are top level functional requirements, not technology

Prompt: Add or Edit a Feature (docs/features)

Goal
- Case A - If the user passes a feature name, create a new folder in ./docs/pmo/features and a feature.md from the template, then populate placeholders.
- Case B - If the user passes a Feature ID (e.g., F3 or F3-customer-price-waterfall), open and edit the existing feature.md instead of creating a new one.

⸻

Inputs
- input (string) — either:
- a feature name (e.g., Customer price waterfall), or
- a Feature ID (e.g., F3 or F3-customer-price-waterfall)

⸻

Conventions
- Feature folder pattern: F<number>-<slug> (e.g., F7-customer-price-waterfall)
- Slug rules:
- lowercase
- trim whitespace
- replace any run of non‑alphanumeric characters with -
- collapse multiple - into one
- trim leading/trailing -
- Numbering: integers without leading zeros, prefixed by uppercase F (e.g., F1, F2, F10).

⸻

Case A — Create New Feature (input is a feature name)

1. Ensure directories: If ./docs/pmo/features/ does not exist, create it.
2. Determine next number:
   - Scan ./docs/pmo/features for folders matching F<number>-<slug>.
   - next_number = max(existing_numbers) + 1 (or 1 if none exist).
3. Slugify the input name per rules above.
4. Create folder: ./docs/pmo/features/F<next_number>-<slug>.
   - If it already exists, abort with: Target folder already exists; not overwriting: ./docs/pmo/features/F<next_number>-<slug>.
5. Copy template: from ./docs/pmo/templates/feature.md to ./docs/features/F<next_number>-<slug>/feature.md.
   - If template missing, abort with: Template not found at ./docs/pmo/templates/feature.md.
   - If destination file exists, abort with: feature.md already exists; not overwriting.
6. Populate the feature.md file (See how below)
7. Output:
   - created_folder: path
   - feature_id: F<next_number>
   - feature_slug: <slug>
   - file: path to feature.md
   - status: created

⸻

Case B — Edit Existing Feature (input is a Feature ID)

1. Parse input:
   - If ^F\d+$, search for a single folder matching F<number>-*.
   - If ^F\d+-[a-z0-9-]+$, match that exact folder.
2. Resolve folder:
   - If zero matches → abort: Feature not found for input: <input>.
   - If multiple matches (for bare F<number>) → abort: Multiple matches for <input>; please specify the full ID, e.g., F<number>-<slug>.
3. Check file: ensure feature.md exists; else abort: feature.md missing in <folder>.
4. Edit policy:
   - Do not renumber or rename the folder.
   - Maintain FEATURE_ID as the resolved F<number>.
5. Edit the feature.md file as the user request
6. Output:
   - edited_folder: path
   - feature_id: F<number>
   - file: path to feature.md
   - status: edited

Edge Cases & Errors
- Missing features dir: create ./docs/pmo/features.
- Missing template: fail with helpful error and expected path.
- Empty/invalid slug after slugify: fail with Feature name produced an empty slug; choose a different name.
- Permissions: fail with OS error message and path.
- Idempotency: never overwrite existing folders/files without explicit instruction.

⸻

Acceptance Criteria
- New features are numbered sequentially and follow the F<number>-<slug> convention.
- feature.md is created from the template and contains no unreplaced placeholders.
- Editing by Feature ID updates only intended fields; IDs and numbering are preserved.
- Success output includes paths and identifiers; failures return clear, actionable messages.

⸻

Optional Implementation Notes (for automation tools)
- Folder scan: match with regex ^F(\d+)-[a-z0-9-]+$.
- Number extraction: cast captured group to int for max().
- Slugify regex: replace [^a-z0-9]+ with -, then trim ^-+|-+$.
- Clock: today override if provided; else use system local date.

⸻

Example Runs

- Create: input = Customer price waterfall
  → creates ./docs/pmo/features/F3-customer-price-waterfall/feature.md with populated fields.
  Output includes feature_id=F3, feature_slug=customer-price-waterfall.
- Edit: input = F3
  → finds unique folder F3-customer-price-waterfall, edits feature.md per user instructions.
  Output includes status=edited.

## Populating feature.md

Populate all sections based your knowledge of the Gain Platform which you can get from:
- Ensure you follow ./docs/README.md for Functional advice on the Gain Platform that we are building
- Use ./docs/components/** for Platform Details
- Scan the codebase (multiple repos) to understanding existing capability
- Ask the user for more information when something in unclear - do not assume features

Remember:
- This is a demo platform. Do not over complicate the requirements
- Do not focus on production style requirements such as page loading time etc
- We are working towards an MVP - it does not need to be polished.
