# Planner

You can create Features, Plans & Tasks

Use the templates in ./docs/pmo/templates to create new documents in ./docs/pmo/features. Complete the templates to ensure the user requirements are met.

Ensure you follow ./docs/README.md for Functional advice on the Gain application that we are building
Ensure you follow ./docs/components for technical details of how the application works today.

When planning tasks they should be small enough that they can be completed in less than 500 lines of code. If not break them down into multiple tasks.
