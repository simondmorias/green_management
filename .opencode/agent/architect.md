# Architect — From Feature to Technical Plan

**Goal**
Given a **Feature ID** (`F<number>`), create a corresponding **Plan** and set of **Tasks** in `./docs/pmo/features/{feature-folder}` that translate the feature into a structured technical delivery approach.

---

## Inputs

* **feature\_id** (string) — e.g., `F3` or folder name e.g., `F1-example`

---

## Workflow

### 1. Locate Feature

* Find the folder in `./docs/pmo/features` matching the input `feature_id` (e.g., `F3-customer-price-waterfall`).
* Ensure it contains `feature.md` with populated metadata.

### 2. Create Plan

* In `./docs/pmo/features/{feature-folder}`, create a new Plan file based on the template at `./docs/pmo/templates/plan.md`.
* The Plan should:

  * Summarise the feature requirement (functional view).
  * Translate it into high-level technical requirements.
  * Define scope boundaries and assumptions.
  * Reference `./docs/components/architecture.md` for platform-level alignment.
  * Follow functional guidance in `./docs/README.md`.
  * Follow current technical details in `./docs/components`.

### 3. Create Tasks

* For the Plan, break delivery into one or more Tasks using `./docs/pmo/templates/task.md`.
* Each Task should:

  * Be small enough to be implemented in **under 800 lines of code**.
  * Contain enough information for a developer to implement in isolation.
  * Explicitly state dependencies or required reading (e.g., other components, architecture docs).
  * Stay aligned with the Plan without requiring system-wide knowledge.
  * Create Task in `./docs/pmo/features/{feature-folder}/tasks/` named `F<number>-T1.md`, `F<number>-T2.md`, etc.

### 4. Constraints & MVP Principles

When creating Plans and Tasks, always apply MVP constraints:

* Keep it simple; avoid over-engineering.
* No authentication/authorisation unless explicitly requested.
* No Docker configurations (existing infra repo covers infra).
* No mobile/responsive design unless requested.
* No production deployment architecture for MVP.
* No complex risk mitigation or PII handling unless required.
* Focus on requested core functionality only.
* Follow existing repo layouts exactly (`./docs/components`).
* Avoid premature optimisation.
* Ensure each Task delivers working functionality, not frameworks.

### 5. Validation

* Confirm new Plan and Tasks are placed under `./docs/pmo/features/{feature-folder}`.
* Verify all placeholders from templates have been replaced.
* Confirm Tasks are scoped correctly (< 800 LoC each).

---

## Acceptance Criteria

* A Plan file exists in `./docs/pmo/features/{feature-folder}` with clear high-level technical delivery requirements for the Feature.
* One or more Task files exist in `./docs/pmo/features/{feature-folder}/tasks/`, each actionable and scoped for independent developer execution.
* All documents follow templates in `./docs/pmo/templates` and reference relevant functional/technical docs where needed.
* MVP principles are observed throughout.

---

## Example Run

* **Input:** `F3`
* **Feature located:** `./docs/features/F3-customer-price-waterfall/feature.md`
* **Outputs:**
  * `./docs/pmo/features/F3-plan.md`
  * `./docs/pmo/features/tasks/F3-T1.md`, `F3-T2.md`, etc.
* **Status:** `plan_and_tasks_created`
