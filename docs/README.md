# Gain

## Overview

Gain is an AI-native platform built to transform how CPG companies make revenue decisions. Unlike dashboards or spreadsheets, Gain provides a conversational, prescriptive, and role-specific experience that gives instant answers to the commercial questions teams face every day — from promo planning and pricing to pack strategy and margin defence.

At its core, Gain acts as a copilot for RGM and commercial leaders. It enables users to run scenario simulations, compare outcomes, and get guided recommendations without relying on a data science team. Responses are visual, embedded, and easy to share, giving frontline sales and trade teams clarity in retailer conversations.

Designed for RGM leaders, Sales Directors, and Commercial Managers — with value for Finance, Shopper Marketing, and Trade Planning — Gain helps organisations overcome dashboard fatigue, cut delays between insight and action, and democratise revenue decision-making across the business.

Fast to deploy and built on modern data stacks (Databricks, Snowflake, TPM tools), Gain integrates seamlessly with retailer and syndicated data. Backed by Primrose Intelligence and supported by partners such as Microsoft, Gain is already piloting with leading brands.

## User Experience

Designing the Conversational RGM Solution: User Journeys & UI Flow

The desired user experience for Gain is built around a conversational-first interface that makes complex revenue growth management (RGM) tasks intuitive, fast, and collaborative. The design ensures that even non-technical users can integrate data, define goals, and act on insights through natural dialogue with an AI assistant.

Onboarding & Data Integration

When users log in, they are welcomed by an AI assistant that guides setup in plain language. Instead of technical forms, the user simply drags and drops Nielsen, IRI, or EPOS data, or connects data sources directly. The system confirms ingestion, highlights mismatches, and auto-harmonises to product masters. Within minutes, it provides a conversational summary of plan vs actuals, surfacing immediate value.

Conversational Home & Visual Insights

The home screen is chat-centric. Users type questions such as “Show me last month’s revenue by product mix” and receive answers accompanied by embedded charts or tables. Dashboards exist as a secondary layer for deeper dives, but the chat remains the control centre. Every visual comes with plain-language explanations, ensuring clarity and trust.

Mission Setup & Goal Orientation

Growth missions are created conversationally. A user might state, “Improve Brand A revenue by 0.5% in Q2.” The AI parses, confirms, and asks about constraints (e.g. fixed Tesco pricing, promo budgets). Missions are logged automatically with targets, timelines, and status—turning business objectives into live, trackable plans without manual configuration.

Recommendations & Strategy Selection

Behind the scenes, specialised agents analyse pricing, promotions, mix, and pack opportunities. The AI then presents options as clear, quantified strategies (e.g. “+2% price on Brand A Premium, net +0.5% revenue uplift”). Each option includes rationale, charts, and trade-offs. Users select or combine strategies directly in chat, with the AI refining details and updating the mission plan.

Continuous Monitoring & Alerts

As new data arrives, the AI proactively updates the user: “Revenue is +0.3% QTD, slightly behind target due to competitor promotions.” If a mission is off track, the assistant alerts the user and proposes corrective actions. Successes are celebrated, and completed missions prompt users to set new goals.

Ad-hoc Analysis & Learning Loop

Users can ask spontaneous questions—“Which pack drove the most margin last quarter?”—and receive data-backed, explainable answers. Over time, the assistant learns constraints and preferences, ensuring recommendations remain realistic and context-aware.

⸻

In short, Gain delivers an experience of “conversation over clicks.” It transforms static dashboards into proactive, explainable guidance, giving CPG teams an AI-powered copilot for revenue growth decisions.
