## Task Requirements

### Task1: Entity Pill React Components
**Status:** Completed

**Description:**
Implement React components for displaying recognized entities as styled pills inline with chat text. Components should support different entity types with distinct visual treatments, hover states, and click interactions while maintaining accessibility standards.

**Technical Details:**
- Files to create/modify:
  - `/gain/apps/web/components/chat/EntityPill.tsx` - Individual pill component
  - `/gain/apps/web/components/chat/HighlightedText.tsx` - Text parser and renderer
  - `/gain/apps/web/components/chat/EntityPill.module.css` - Pill styling
  - `/gain/apps/web/hooks/useEntityRecognition.ts` - Custom hook for recognition
  - `/gain/apps/web/types/entities.ts` - TypeScript types
  - `/gain/apps/web/components/chat/ChatInput.tsx` - Modify to add recognition

- Key implementation points:
  - Parse XML-style tags from API response
  - Render pills with type-specific gradients (manufacturers=blue, products=green, metrics=purple, time=orange)
  - Add hover effects with scale and shadow
  - Support keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Delete)
  - Show confidence indicators for uncertain matches (dashed border)
  - Preserve cursor position during re-renders
  - Implement smooth transitions (200ms)
  - Ensure WCAG AA color contrast compliance
  - Add screen reader announcements

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Pills render correctly for all entity types
- [x] Type-specific colors and gradients applied
- [x] Hover states work with proper animations
- [x] Keyboard navigation fully functional
- [x] Low-confidence entities show dashed borders
- [x] Cursor position preserved during updates
- [x] Component renders in < 50ms
- [x] Accessibility audit passes WCAG AA
- [x] Unit tests for component rendering passing

### Summary of Changes

**Overview**

Successfully implemented React components for live entity highlighting with interactive pills in the chat interface. The implementation includes a complete component system with EntityPill for individual entities, HighlightedText for parsing and rendering tagged text, a custom useEntityRecognition hook for API integration, and an EnhancedMessageInput component that brings everything together.

The EntityPill component provides type-specific visual treatments with gradient backgrounds for different entity types (manufacturers in blue, products in green, metrics in purple, time periods in orange). It supports full keyboard navigation with Tab, Enter, and Delete keys, includes hover effects with smooth 200ms transitions, and shows confidence indicators with dashed borders for uncertain matches. The component is fully accessible with ARIA labels and screen reader support.

The HighlightedText component efficiently parses XML-style tagged text from the API and renders entities as pills inline with regular text. It handles overlapping entities correctly, preserves text formatting, and supports both position-based and tag-based rendering approaches. The component uses React.useMemo for performance optimization, ensuring rendering completes in under 50ms even with multiple entities.

The useEntityRecognition custom hook provides a clean interface for entity recognition with automatic debouncing (500ms default), request cancellation for in-flight requests, comprehensive error handling, and performance metrics tracking. The hook manages loading states, caches results, and provides methods for manual recognition and clearing.

The EnhancedMessageInput component integrates entity recognition seamlessly into the chat input, showing real-time entity highlights as users type. It preserves cursor position during re-renders, syncs scroll position between textarea and highlight overlay, displays recognition status and processing time, and allows toggling highlight visibility. The component maintains full backward compatibility with the existing MessageInput interface.

Key technical achievements:
1. WCAG AA compliance with proper color contrast ratios and keyboard navigation
2. Performance optimization with sub-50ms rendering for complex entity layouts
3. Smooth animations with CSS transitions respecting prefers-reduced-motion
4. Dark mode support with appropriate adjustments
5. Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
6. Proper TypeScript typing throughout the implementation

Challenges resolved:
- Cursor position preservation required careful handling of React re-renders
- Overlay synchronization needed precise scroll position tracking
- Entity pill positioning in flowing text required flexible CSS layouts
- Accessibility required extensive ARIA attributes and keyboard event handling
