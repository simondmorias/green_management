## Task Requirements

### Task1: Performance Testing and Optimization
**Status:** Not Started

**Description:**
Create performance test suite, run load tests simulating 1000 concurrent users, identify bottlenecks, and implement optimizations to meet performance targets. Document baseline metrics and improvements.

**Technical Details:**
- Files to create/modify:
  - `/gain/apps/api/tests/performance/test_entity_recognition_load.py` - Load tests
  - `/gain/apps/api/tests/performance/locustfile.py` - Locust configuration
  - `/gain/apps/api/app/services/entity_recognizer.py` - Apply optimizations
  - `/gain/apps/api/app/services/cache_manager.py` - Cache tuning
  - `/gain/docs/performance/entity_recognition_benchmarks.md` - Results documentation

- Key implementation points:
  - Create Locust test simulating realistic query patterns
  - Test with 100, 500, 1000 concurrent users
  - Measure P50, P95, P99 latencies
  - Profile code to identify bottlenecks
  - Optimize Aho-Corasick trie construction
  - Tune Redis connection pool size
  - Implement request batching where applicable
  - Add circuit breaker for degraded performance
  - Document optimization techniques applied

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] P95 latency < 100ms with 1000 concurrent users
- [ ] P99 latency < 200ms under load
- [ ] Cache hit ratio > 80% during tests
- [ ] No memory leaks detected over 1-hour test
- [ ] CPU usage remains below 80% on 4-core machine
- [ ] Throughput > 100 requests/second sustained
- [ ] Performance regression tests added to CI
- [ ] Optimization documentation complete
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards configured
