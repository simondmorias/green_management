## Task Requirements

### Task1: Redis Cache Configuration and Management
**Status:** Not Started

**Description:**
Set up Redis caching layer with appropriate configuration for entity artifacts (24-hour TTL) and recognition results (15-minute TTL). Implement cache management utilities including loading, invalidation, and monitoring capabilities.

**Technical Details:**
- Files to create/modify:
  - `/gain/apps/api/app/services/cache_manager.py` - Cache management service
  - `/gain/apps/api/app/services/artifact_loader.py` - Artifact loading and caching
  - `/gain/apps/api/app/deps.py` - Add Redis connection dependency
  - `/gain/packages/persistence/models.py` - Add entity_cache_stats table
  - `/gain/packages/persistence/alembic/versions/xxx_add_entity_cache_stats.py` - Migration
  - `/infra/docker-compose.yml` - Update Redis configuration

- Key implementation points:
  - Configure Redis with 2GB max memory and LRU eviction policy
  - Implement artifact loader with lazy loading on startup
  - Create cache key patterns for artifacts and results
  - Add cache warming on application startup
  - Implement cache invalidation endpoints
  - Add performance metrics collection (hit rate, latency)
  - Handle cache misses gracefully
  - Implement connection pooling for Redis

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Redis configured with 2GB memory limit
- [ ] Artifact cache with 24-hour TTL implemented
- [ ] Result cache with 15-minute TTL implemented
- [ ] Cache hit rate > 80% in testing
- [ ] Cache warming completes in < 5 seconds
- [ ] Graceful degradation when cache unavailable
- [ ] Performance metrics logged to database
- [ ] Unit tests for cache operations passing
- [ ] Integration with existing Redis broker verified
