## Task Requirements

### Task1: Aho-Corasick Entity Matcher Implementation
**Status:** Completed

**Description:**
Build the entity recognition service that uses Aho-Corasick automaton for efficient multi-pattern matching. The service should process text in under 100ms, identify entity boundaries correctly, and return tagged text with entity metadata.

**Technical Details:**
- Files to create/modify:
  - `/gain/apps/api/app/services/entity_recognizer.py` - Core recognition service
  - `/gain/apps/api/app/services/aho_corasick_matcher.py` - Aho-Corasick implementation
  - `/gain/apps/api/app/routes/chat.py` - Add recognition endpoint
  - `/gain/apps/api/app/schemas/entity_recognition.py` - Request/response schemas
  - `/gain/apps/api/tests/test_entity_recognition.py` - Unit tests

- Key implementation points:
  - Implement Aho-Corasick trie construction from gazetteer
  - Add word boundary detection to avoid partial matches
  - Handle overlapping entities with priority rules (Manufacturer > Product > Metric > Time)
  - Case-insensitive matching with original case preservation
  - Generate XML-style tags for matched entities
  - Include entity metadata (type, ID, confidence, position)
  - Optimize for sub-100ms processing
  - Add stopword filtering for performance

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] Entity recognition completes in < 100ms for 95% of queries
- [x] Exact match accuracy > 99%
- [x] Word boundaries correctly detected
- [x] Overlapping entities handled by priority rules
- [x] Case-insensitive matching works correctly
- [x] Response includes tagged text and entity metadata
- [x] Handles queries up to 500 characters
- [x] Unit tests achieve > 90% coverage
- [x] API endpoint returns proper error codes

### Summary of Changes

**Overview**

Successfully implemented the core entity recognition service using the Aho-Corasick algorithm for efficient multi-pattern string matching. The implementation consists of three main components: the Aho-Corasick matcher for pattern matching, the EntityMatcher for entity-specific logic, and the EntityRecognitionService that provides the API interface.

The Aho-Corasick implementation provides O(n) time complexity for matching multiple patterns simultaneously, making it ideal for real-time entity recognition. The algorithm builds a trie structure with failure links that enable efficient traversal when patterns don't match. Key features include case-insensitive matching, word boundary detection to avoid partial matches, and support for overlapping patterns.

The EntityMatcher layer adds entity-specific functionality including loading patterns from gazetteer and aliases, handling different entity types (manufacturers, brands, products, metrics, time periods), resolving overlapping entities using priority rules (manufacturer > brand > product > category > metric > time_period), and generating XML-style tagged text output. The service successfully processes the 499 entities and 2,693 aliases generated from Databricks.

The EntityRecognitionService provides a clean API interface with artifact loading on startup, graceful fallback to default artifacts if files are missing, caching support for repeated queries, and comprehensive error handling. The service meets the performance requirement of sub-100ms processing for 95% of queries.

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Aho-Corasick Matcher (`aho_corasick_matcher.py`)**:
   - Implemented efficient trie-based pattern matching with failure links
   - Added word boundary detection to prevent partial matches (e.g., "Mars" in "Marshmallow")
   - Case-insensitive matching while preserving original case in output
   - Overlap resolution using entity type priority system
   - Stopword filtering to improve performance

2. **Entity Recognition Service (`entity_recognizer.py`)**:
   - Singleton service pattern for efficient resource usage
   - Integration with artifact loader and cache manager from F3-T2
   - Fuzzy matching integration for enhanced results
   - Performance monitoring with sub-100ms target
   - Graceful error handling and fallback mechanisms
   - Module-level caching for repeated queries

3. **FastAPI Endpoint (`routes/chat.py`)**:
   - POST `/chat/recognize-entities` endpoint for real-time recognition
   - Request validation with 500 character limit
   - Comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes
   - Support for optional fuzzy matching and confidence thresholds
   - Cache management endpoints for development and debugging

4. **Pydantic Schemas (`schemas/entity_recognition.py`)**:
   - Structured request/response models with validation
   - Entity metadata schema with display names, IDs, and confidence scores
   - Example schemas for API documentation
   - Type safety for all API interactions

5. **Comprehensive Testing (`tests/test_entity_recognition.py`)**:
   - Unit tests for Aho-Corasick algorithm components
   - Entity matcher tests with realistic data scenarios
   - Service integration tests with mocked dependencies
   - Performance tests to verify sub-100ms requirement
   - Error handling and edge case coverage

**Technical challenges resolved during implementation:**
1. Word boundary detection required careful handling of edge cases to avoid matching "Mars" in "Marshmallow"
2. Overlap resolution needed a priority system to handle cases like "Mars Bar" where both "Mars" (manufacturer) and "Mars Bar" (product) could match
3. The service needed to handle missing artifact files gracefully by providing sensible defaults
4. Case-insensitive matching while preserving original case in output required careful text handling
5. LRU cache integration required module-level functions due to Python's caching limitations with instance methods

The API endpoint at `/chat/recognize-entities` accepts POST requests with text up to 500 characters and returns tagged text with recognized entities, their positions, types, and confidence scores. Comprehensive unit tests cover all major functionality including exact matching, case sensitivity, word boundaries, overlapping patterns, alias recognition, and error handling.

**Testing Notes:**
- Test exact pattern matching with multiple entity types
- Verify case-insensitive matching works correctly
- Confirm word boundaries prevent partial matches
- Test overlap resolution with priority rules
- Verify alias recognition maps to correct display names
- Test performance with full artifact set (< 100ms requirement)
- Verify graceful degradation when artifacts are missing

**Definition of Done:**
- [x] Code implemented and peer reviewed
- [x] Tests written and passing
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] No linting errors
- [x] Ready for PR and Approval
