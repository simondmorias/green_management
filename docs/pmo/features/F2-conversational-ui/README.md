# F2 - Conversational UI for Gain

## Feature Overview

This feature implements the foundational conversational interface for Gain, enabling users to interact with the AI-native RGM platform through natural language. The implementation provides a chat-based homepage where CPG commercial operators can ask questions, receive insights, and initiate revenue growth management tasks through conversation rather than traditional dashboard navigation.

## Documentation Structure

### Core Documents
- **[feature.md](./feature.md)** - Complete feature specification with business requirements, user stories, and acceptance criteria
- **[plan.md](./plan.md)** - Technical implementation plan with architecture decisions and component breakdown
- **[file-structure.md](./file-structure.md)** - Detailed file structure and implementation guide for the `/gain` repository

### Implementation Tasks
- **[T1.md](./tasks/T1.md)** - Database Schema and API Foundation
- **[T2.md](./tasks/T2.md)** - SSE Streaming and Mock Response Service  
- **[T3.md](./tasks/T3.md)** - React Chat Interface Components
- **[T4.md](./tasks/T4.md)** - Integration Testing and Polish

## Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- Docker Compose environment running
- Postgres database with pgvector extension
- Redis for Celery broker
- Next.js frontend and FastAPI backend setup

### Implementation Sequence
1. **Start with T1** - Establish database schema and basic API structure
2. **Continue with T2** - Implement SSE streaming and mock responses
3. **Build T3** - Create React components and frontend integration
4. **Complete with T4** - Testing, optimization, and production readiness

### Key Architecture Decisions
- **SSE for Streaming**: Real-time response delivery using Server-Sent Events
- **Mock Response System**: Realistic business responses for development and testing
- **Single Database**: Postgres with pgvector for all conversation data
- **Queue-based Processing**: Celery + Redis for async message processing
- **Conversational-First UI**: Clean chat interface as primary interaction method

## Business Value

### Primary Benefits
- **Reduced Time-to-Insight**: From hours/days to seconds through conversational queries
- **Increased User Adoption**: Eliminates dashboard complexity and training requirements
- **Self-Service Analytics**: Enables RGM leaders and commercial teams to get answers independently
- **Scalable Foundation**: Architecture ready for AI agent integration and advanced capabilities

### Target Users
- **RGM Leaders**: Strategic insights and scenario analysis
- **Sales Directors**: Retailer conversation support and real-time data
- **Commercial Managers**: Promotional effectiveness and pricing guidance

## Technical Highlights

### Frontend (Next.js)
- React components with TypeScript
- Real-time SSE integration
- Responsive design with accessibility compliance
- Context-based state management

### Backend (FastAPI)
- RESTful API with OpenAPI documentation
- SSE streaming endpoints
- Mock response service with business context
- Integration with existing authentication

### Database (Postgres)
- Conversation threads and message persistence
- UUID-based primary keys
- JSONB metadata for extensibility
- Optimized indexing for performance

### Processing (Celery + Redis)
- Async message processing
- Real-time event emission
- Error handling and retry logic
- Performance monitoring

## Success Metrics

### Technical KPIs
- Average response time < 3 seconds
- SSE streaming latency < 100ms
- 90%+ test coverage
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

### Business KPIs
- User session duration increase by 40%
- Query completion rate > 85%
- User satisfaction score > 4.2/5
- Intuitive first-time user experience

## Future Enhancements
