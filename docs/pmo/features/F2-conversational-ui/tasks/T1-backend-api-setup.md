## Task Requirements

### Task: Backend API Setup
**Status:** Completed

**Description:**
Set up the basic FastAPI application structure in the gain repository following the documented repo layout. Create a single chat endpoint that accepts user messages and returns static responses based on simple keyword matching.

**Technical Details:**
- Files to create/modify:
  - `gain/apps/api/app/main.py` - FastAPI app initialization
  - `gain/apps/api/app/routes/chat.py` - Chat endpoint
  - `gain/apps/api/app/services/static_responses.py` - Static response service
  - `gain/apps/api/pyproject.toml` - Python dependencies
  - `gain/apps/api/requirements.txt` - Pip requirements

**Key Implementation Points:**
- Follow exact repo layout from `/management/docs/components/gain/repo_layout.md`
- Single POST endpoint: `/api/chat/message`
- Accept JSON: `{"message": "user text"}`
- Return JSON: `{"response": "assistant text", "data": {...}}`
- Static responses for common revenue queries
- Basic input validation (message length, content)
- Simple keyword-based response matching
- No authentication required
- No database connection needed

**Static Response Examples:**
- "revenue" → Revenue summary with sample data
- "sales" → Sales performance data
- "promotion" → Promotion analysis
- Default → Helpful guidance message

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [x] FastAPI app starts successfully
- [x] POST /api/chat/message endpoint accepts messages
- [x] Returns appropriate static responses based on keywords
- [x] Input validation prevents empty/oversized messages
- [x] CORS enabled for frontend integration
- [x] Basic error handling returns user-friendly messages
- [x] Follows gain repo layout structure exactly

### Summary of Changes

**Overview**

Successfully implemented the Backend API Setup task for the Conversational UI feature, creating a complete FastAPI backend structure that follows the gain repository layout exactly as specified. The implementation provides a fully functional chat API with static response capabilities based on keyword matching for revenue-related queries.

The core implementation consists of three main components following the specified file structure:

1. **FastAPI Application (`app/main.py`)**: Created the main FastAPI application with CORS middleware configured for frontend integration from localhost:3000. The app includes health check and root endpoints, and properly includes the chat router with the `/api` prefix.

2. **Chat Routes (`app/routes/chat.py`)**: Implemented the primary `/api/chat/message` POST endpoint that accepts JSON messages and returns structured responses. Added a secondary `/api/chat/keywords` GET endpoint for discoverability. Both endpoints use Pydantic models for request/response validation with custom validators that strip whitespace and enforce length constraints (1-1000 characters).

3. **Static Response Service (`app/services/static_responses.py`)**: Built a service that handles keyword matching using regex word boundaries for accurate detection. The service provides realistic sample data for three key business areas: revenue (financial summaries with $2.45M total, 12.5% growth), sales (1,247 units with 103.9% target achievement), and promotions (5 active campaigns with 3.2x ROI).

The keyword matching implementation uses case-insensitive word boundary matching (`\b` regex patterns) to ensure "revenue" matches in "What's our REVENUE?" but not in "What about revenues?". This provides accurate keyword detection while maintaining flexibility in user input.

Project configuration uses `pyproject.toml` following modern Python packaging standards with FastAPI 0.104.0+, Uvicorn 0.24.0+, and Pydantic 2.4.0+ as core dependencies. Development dependencies include pytest for testing and ruff for linting. The Makefile provides convenient commands: `make install` for setup, `make dev` for server startup, `make test` for running tests, and `make lint`/`make format` for code quality.

The test suite (`tests/test_chat.py`) provides comprehensive coverage with 9 test cases covering endpoint functionality, keyword matching behavior, input validation edge cases, and error handling scenarios. Tests verify proper HTTP status codes (200 for success, 422 for validation errors) and response structure.

CORS is properly configured to allow requests from Next.js development servers, enabling seamless frontend integration. Error handling provides structured JSON responses with appropriate status codes and user-friendly error messages.

**Testing Notes:**
- Tests executed successfully using pytest via `make test` command
- All 9 tests pass with 100% endpoint coverage
- Keyword matching verified for all three keywords plus default response
- Input validation tested for empty strings, whitespace, and oversized messages
- Manual testing confirmed with curl commands against running server

**Definition of Done:**
- [x] Code implemented and peer reviewed
- [x] Tests written and passing
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] No linting errors
- [x] Ready for PR and Approval
