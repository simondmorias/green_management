### Architectural Decisions
| Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| [Key decision] | [Why this approach] | [System implications] |

### Design Principles Applied
- [ ] Local-first development (Docker Compose)
- [ ] Fail-fast approach (no silent failures)
- [ ] Any new technologies/libraries/frameworks clearly explained in Architectural Decisions
- [ ] High Level Design is Clear and Simple, not over complicated or adding features not requested by the Feature document
